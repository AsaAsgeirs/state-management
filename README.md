--------------------------------------------------------
A simple counter with a state that is updated with a click of a button.

I went through this [tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpdFj8MEuJA&ab_channel=JackHerrington), it shows many ways to many ways to manage state by using useState, useReducer, Context and other third party solutions. Each solution has it's own page that are in the folders "pages/counter" or "pages/ecommerce", showing the use of state with counter or cart and login/logout function.

The third party solutions used are:

- [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand)
- [context-selector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/context-selector)
